# Bank Account Management App
- This is my first project in Java
- The app works, but I am still adding some features, such as persistent memory and more error handling.

## Instructions:
- Enter an integer between 1 and 8 according to the menu options to select an action.
- 1 - Adds a new customer
- 2 - Removes a customer
- 3 - See a customer's current balance
- 4 - Make a deposit
- 5 - Make a withdrawal
- 6 - See a customer's name, account number, balance, and transaction history
- 7 - Show the options menu
- 8 - Exit the program
